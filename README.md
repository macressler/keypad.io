keypad.io
=========

keypas.io uses WebSockets and Java to send keystrokes in real time to your computer from any mobile device.

To use
-------
1) Visit keypad.io on your desktop.  Download and run the portable .jar file

2) Visit keypad.io on your mobile device. Enter the same info that the desktop client gave you.

3) Type using your phone/tablet on your computer from any range over the web!

Special thanks to @tootallnate for the Java Websocket Library.

NOTICE:  This implementation is not the most secure, but because of the limitations of the client, only letters a-z, space and backspace can be sent.
